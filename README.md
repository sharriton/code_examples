Customer

This was a practice with OOP. The goal was to pull records from a text file with variable size customer records, fill each customers corresponding object with data, manipulate the data, sort the data, find average values of all customers etc.

This app was designed for Vtown Cartel Music. It's still a work in progress. There's more functionality that the client wants. 
Many of the OOP items have yet to be fully installed. Vtown is a music licensing company here in California. They have a 
database of around 50,000 entries and 180 rows. There is a field called Mood. They wanted to create a program that would 
scan mood keywords by category from a separate text file. I’ll call that file ‘Z’ for clarity sake. After those keyword 
categories were copied, they wanted the app to iterate through the 50,000 entries in the database and compare the mood field 
against the different keyword categories from file ‘Z’. If one of the mood keywords present in the main database was also in a 
category from file ‘Z’, then all of the other keywords in that category would get added to that corresponding mood field 
in the main database. The employer was hoping to standardize that field of the database and make it more consistent when 
TV/Film clients searched through the database looking for music they needed. The challenge was to deliver what they wanted
without duplicate keywords in the main database.

Due to the nature of my contract, I can’t upload the main database. The code opens in a text file or IDE if you want to 
see my work, but it won't actually run without the BPB database csv. The test keyword text file is included.
